## Score: 4

#### Score reason

Very expensive, no parking + difficult to find public free parking, no security, requires time to complete.

#### Comments about this office:

13min walk to Praxis, approx distance 1.1km

Building is currently under renovation. Floor and ceiling left for tenant to choose positioning and style. View to the city, partialy sea view with small covered vernada. Includes small kitchen and one room.

Renovation may take about 2 months.

Located on the seafront, main street with all amentities in close proximity. 

Ground floor: TGI Friday's. 

Very difficult for parking, office doesn't include any parking spaces. We can pay monthly about 50 eur per parking but that doesn't guarantee parking space. Its just monthly public parking ticket and park across the street if we can find free parking place. This parking is usually full.

No security in the building, no reception and no office security. Small building entrance.

Office features open plan + 1 room and fiber optic Internet.
