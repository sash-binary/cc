## Score: 2

#### Score reason

Lowest quality office, low tech, old building with fiber internet, wall partitions, no open plan, old kitchen and toilets (must be replaced), dark, needs painting and AC checks. Decent security in and arround the building including parking. Includes spacious quality reception (outdated look and feel), difficult access (one way street), parking availability questionable, no shared veranda, 15-20 min to highway, on the seafront. This office will require significant repairs.

#### Comments about this office:

4min walk to Praxis, approx distance 200m

This is very old building and office requires painting. Not really bright and pleasant inside. Upon arrival, receptionist couldn't open the parking gate, remote didnt work.

Located on the seafront, main street with all amentities in close proximity. 

Very difficult for parking, office includes 4 parking spaces. We can pay monthly about 50 eur per parking but that doesn't guarantee parking space. Its just monthly public parking ticket.

Office includes 4 covered, secured parking places and public space arround the building for parking (usually occupied).

Double security access, building features reception check point + office access with security card. Security cameras inside, outside and in the underground parking. Security and fire alarms.

Office features reception, server room, optional fiber optic Internet.
