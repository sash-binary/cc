## Score: 9

#### Score reason

Very spacoius, open plan, brand new (renovation in progress), bright office with large private, covered veranda.

We can choose floor and ceiling color and style + AC / cable locations. Parking availabilty very good and we can rent extra parking space. 

Note, this office will be better quality than waywin, includes 3 toilets, kitchen and large private veranda.

Very good location, business area, everything in close proximity, main road. 

Older but well maintened building.

#### Comments about this office:

This is a 5 level building, only level 4 is available with only 2 offices, both 500sqm and both new.

Few years old building with reception and secure access. 

Located on the main street with all amentities in close proximity, 3 min drive from the highway and 10 min to the sea.

Parking availability very good. 

Large private covered veranda.

Price negotiable. Agent suggested we can drop to 7.500 pm, maybe even more.

High profile companies in the building, including TUI, Fesco, InReach and building developer itself (one of the largest) in Cyprus.

All works to be completed within 30 days from the day of signing provided we give them instructions (floor / ceiling) within few days.
