Lowest cost for given features, high quality building and office, high tech building with high tech features including fiber internet, glass partitions + open plan + kitchen + backup power generator.

#### Comments about this office:

High quality, high tech, in the city area on the main road. 

5 min drive to the highway and 15 min to the seafront.

10-15min drive to Praxis

Office includes 3 covered, secured parking places. Nearest parking is about 500m and is charged extra at about 50eur per parking, per month. Very difficult for parking.

Double security access, building features reception check point + office access with security card. Security cameras inside, outside and in the underground parking. Security and fire alarms. Out of office hours building is locked down, access only with security card. 

The owner is not really happy about 24h office access but allows this option. I got impression he feels we are renting a part of his home and will interfeare in the future.

Office features reception, open plan, server room, fiber optic Internet, semi partitioned and modern.

No common area. 

Includes backup power generator.

Building owner is on the ground floor, strict personalty and doesnt agree with one month free while we setup.

Negotiable.

Office is currently occupied and I was not allowed flming or taking pictures. 

Agent listing shows mixed images, office itself (not furnished) and ground floor office (furnished) used by the owner.

In essence, the building and office are high tech and quality. But location is not so good and owner may give us problems.

Office is on the first floor (brownish / glass building)

Office will be available from 1st sep. Current tenant is leaving and owner will cleanup and paing office.
